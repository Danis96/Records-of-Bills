# Records-of-Bills
This is JAVA app with Hibernate
In this app I use Java with Hibernate to create an ongoing flow of informations. From database to the user.

You can enter your monthly bills, and they will be archived in the database. 
So you can easily look through all the bills.

 Here you can search through the bills. You have various criteriums to look for. By the bill, payer, amount, or the date.

Or you can maybe send an email with your bills documents in it.
